# List Pagination and Filtering

JavaScript is used to paginate a page that contains list of basic information about students data. On each page, information about 10 students are displayed and a navigation system -- a series of links at the bottom of the page -- to let users click through the other student entries, 10 at a time. The pagination solution is flexible to respond to lists of different lengths
